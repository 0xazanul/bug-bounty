## Scenario 1


To test if your target redacted.com is vulnerable to the email verification bypass exploit, follow these precise steps:

Requirements:
Two email accounts:
Attacker-controlled email: An email you can access (e.g., abc@gmail.com).
Target email: A victim's email address on redacted.com (e.g., target@redacted.com).
HTTP Interception Tool: Use Burp Suite or a similar proxy to monitor and manipulate requests.

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Initial Setup with Attacker-Controlled Email:
- Log into your account on redacted.com.
- Go to the account settings and change the email to your attacker-controlled email (abc@gmail.com).
- Capture the verification link sent to abc@gmail.com but do not click it.

2.Switch to Target Email:
- Change the email to the target email (e.g., target@redacted.com) via the same account settings.
- A new email verification link will be sent to target@redacted.com. Since you don't have access to this email, ignore it.

3.Reuse the Attacker-Controlled Verification Link:
- Open the initial email verification link sent to abc@gmail.com and use it to "verify" the target email (target@redacted.com).
- If the system is flawed, it may incorrectly associate the verification link with the target email.
Validation Test:

Check whether the target email (target@redacted.com) is now linked and verified under your account.
